        <div style="float: left; width: 45%">
      <p style="font-size:130%;">You start running for the shack that controls all the power with all the zombies chasing after you. You run around them barely being able to get away from them. You make it into the shack and lock the doors behind you. With the zombies surrounding the shack and knocking on the walls, you flip the switch off and then hear nothing outside. You open the door and see all the zombies not moving on the floor around you. Stepping over them carefully, you walk by them all and climb out of there, and back to your home safe and sound.  </p>
