      <p style="font-size:130%;">You and Sam both bolt towards the door trying to get there before the zombies can get you. You make it to the fence just to find a giant lock holding the gates shut. You try pulling it apart and you realize it is no use. By that time all the zombies are around you and you try your hardest to squeeze your way through the gate but you are much too big to fit through. The zombies get to you and Sam and you both are eaten by the hoard of zombies. </p>
