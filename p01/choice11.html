      <p style="font-size:130%;">You both start running for the fence at full speed, trying to avoid all the zombies in your path. Sam gets grabbed by one of the zombies but it releases its grasp once you hit it on the head with your flashlight. You make it to the fence with the zombies a few feet behind you. As you are climbing the fence the zombies are trying to grab your feet and you have to kick loose. You and Sam both make it over the fence and run all the way back home. </p>
