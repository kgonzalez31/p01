      <p style="font-size:130%;">Sam starts running for the shack while you start screaming and drawing all the attention to you. Sam makes it to the door and is unable to figure out which switches were the ones that turned on the power. At this point you are almost completely surrounded trying to explain to Sam which were the correct switches. The zombies finally get you and start attacking you as Sam barely figures out the right switches. All the zombies start collapsing as she is running to help you but it is too late, you are already dead.</p>
