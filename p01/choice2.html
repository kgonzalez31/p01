      <p style="font-size:130%;">You turn on the power and you hear a loud noise and the some of the rides and lights start to turn on.  You walk out and start seeing all the rides that managed to turn on and still function properly. Before you can decide which ride you want to get on you see someone else in the distance turn a corner. You chase after the person and when you finally catch up and scream at him, he turns around and you realize that he is a zombie and he is coming after you. </p>
