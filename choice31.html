      <p style="font-size:130%;">You run at it at full speed and manage to knock down the zombie. It gets back up quickly and throws itself at you and tackles you to the ground. You try to get up, but the zombie is too strong and it looks like it is the end for you. Just as the zombie is about to finish you, your friend Sam pushes the zombie off and you both run away to hide. She explains how she was worried about you coming alone and about all the other zombies that are roaming around the fair. </p>
