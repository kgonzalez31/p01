      <p style="font-size:130%;">You and Sam both try to sneak your way to the Haunted House. You make it most of the way without being noticed until you trip and cause some commotion. You get noticed by some zombies who follow you into the haunted house and you begin to look for a room to hide in. But the haunted house is a huge maze and there does not seem to be any end to it or any rooms to hide into. Eventually you get surrounded by zombies and there is no way to escape so you get eaten. </p>
