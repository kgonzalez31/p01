      <p style="font-size:130%;">You and Sam both try to sneak your way to the Ferris wheel. You make it most of the way without being noticed until Sam trips and causes commotion. The zombies are now after the both of you and you have to sprint all the way to the Ferris wheel before any of them can get to you. Sam climbs the ladder as you follow right behind and get into the highest seat there is. You both fall asleep, and are awaken by the sun light and all the zombies have cleared away.</p>
