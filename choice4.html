      <p style="font-size:130%;">You start running the opposite direction trying to lose the zombie and you soon realize that there are many more zombies roaming around the fair. You run into a small space between two buildings and crash into someone. Assuming it is a zombie you start attacking it, and then it starts to speak asking you to stop. It turns out to be your friend Sam who decided to come find you because they were worried something might happen. </p>
