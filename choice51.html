      <p style="font-size:130%;">You start asking yourself, why did these zombies all of a sudden start coming to life now? And you realize that these zombies never walked freely like this until you turned on the lights to the entire fair. You know you have to get out of there but if you leave the lights the zombies will never be put to rest. So you and Sam both agree that it is best to try to turn off the light but it should only be one person while the other tries to distract the other zombies.  </p>
